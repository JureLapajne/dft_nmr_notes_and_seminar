  abstract =     {This paper is the outgrowth of lectures the author gave at the
                  Physics Institute and the Chemistry Institute of the
                  University of Sao Paulo at Sao Carlos, Brazil, and at the
                  VIII'th Summer School on Electronic Structure of the Brazilian
                  Physical Society. It is an attempt to introduce
                  density-functional theory (DFT) in a language accessible for
                  students entering the field or researchers from other fields.
                  It is not meant to be a scholarly review of DFT, but rather an
                  informal guide to its conceptual basis and some recent
                  developments and advances. The Hohenberg-Kohn theorem and the
                  Kohn-Sham equations are discussed in some detail. Approximate
                  density functionals, selected aspects of applications of DFT,
                  and a variety of extensions of standard DFT are also
                  discussed, albeit in less detail. Throughout it is attempted
                  to provide a balanced treatment of aspects that are relevant
                  for chemistry and aspects relevant for physics, but with a
                  strong bias towards conceptual foundations. The paper is
                  intended to be read before (or in parallel with) one of the
                  many excellent more technical reviews available in the
                  literature.},

                  spin-polarized density functional theory. First, it is pointed
                  out that for ground states, the nonuniqueness of the external
                  magnetic field B(r) corresponding to a given pair of density
                  n(r) and spin density s(r) in spin-polarized density
                  functional theory implies the nonexistence of the derivative
                  of the SDFT Lieb functional with respect to N_s. Giving a
                  suitable generalization of the Lieb functionals for n(r)'s and
                  s(r)'s with norms not equal to N and N_s of the functionals'
                  subscripts, it is then shown that the Lieb functionals'
                  derivatives with respect to N and N_s are equal to the
                  derivatives, with respect to N and N_s, of the total energies
